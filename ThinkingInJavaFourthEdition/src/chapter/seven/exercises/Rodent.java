 * Exercise 9:  (3) Create an inheritance hierarchy of Rodent: Mouse, Gerbil, Hamster, etc. In the base class,
 *      provide methods that are common to all Rodents, and override these in the derived classes to perform
 *      different behaviors depending on the specific type of Rodent. Create an array of Rodent, fill it with
 *      different specific types of Rodents, and call your base-class methods to see what happens.
