/**
 * Exercise 2:  (1) Following the HelloDate.java example in this chapter, create a hello, world program that
 *      simply displays that statement. You need only a single method in your class (the main one that gets
 *      executed when the program starts). Remember to make it static and to include the argument list, even
 *      though you do not use the argument list. Compile the program with javac and run it using java. If you
 *      are using a different development environment than the JDK, learn how to compile and run programs in
 *      that environment.
